\section{Figures}

\subsection{Lets share an historic moment}

Figure \ref{history} is so amazing  that the rest is indeed obvious.
\begin{figure}[h!tb] \centering

\end{figure}
Captions go beneath figures.

\section{References}

For references, use BibTeX (\url{http://www.bibtex.org/}).
This means you will want a file that includes your references, 
e.g. references.bib, and you will reference them using a set of BibTeX commands.

\cite{niemi2015empirical} constructed a hierachical model and an empirical 
Bayes analysis for RNA-seq data. 
An analysis of RNA-seq data showed large number of genes exhibiting a pattern
of hybrid vigor \citep{niemi2015empirical}.
\citeauthor{niemi2015empirical} can be extended for many different experimental
designs.
